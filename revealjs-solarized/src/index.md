# This theme doesn't actually exist, but the pandoc template
# defaults to black.css if no theme is given. We have our
# own theme that's not in the Reveal.js distribution, so we
# pretend that empty.css exists. The browser will attempt to
# fetch this and fail, and it will be like there was no
# theme.

# TODO(jez) https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/pull/6342
theme: empty

css:
- 'solarized.css'

# See `pandoc -D revealjs` to see more options to the revealjs template.

# These are all strings because they'll be interpolated into
# JS and then become JS values.

# The template auto-wraps this one in quotes
transition: 'none'
# This is a quoted string: needs to still have quotes when
# it's interpolated into JS. It's also escaped so that
# pandoc doesn't turn them into curly quotes.
